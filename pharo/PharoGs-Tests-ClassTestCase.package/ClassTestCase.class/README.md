This class is intended for unit tests of individual classes and their metaclasses.

It provides methods to determine the coverage of the unit tests.

Subclasses are expected to re-implement #classesToBeTested and #selectorsToBeIgnored.

They should also implement to confirm that all methods have been tested.

#testCoverage

	super testCoverage.
